### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

Moving foward, I would like to learn, understand and interweave different HTML elements and tags together.
This task provided me a new learning path of using <span></span> inside other elements and working with it is indeed very helpful.

CSS is majorly fun to use and I would love to see other ways I can use it(that I have not explored).

My major focus in the future will be Javascript(JS) and Python, and the different ways they can be used in websites and maybe systems.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp)- This helped me understand a way to style websites for different device widths and how it works, learning I can adjust the HTML code to different device width media is very useful, especially if the website is for both large screen and small screen devices.
